# gzdoom-last-svn

This is the last snapshot of the old GZDoom SVN repository, converted to git. 

Please note that this is not an active project, it is just posted here to preserve the commit history which could not be transferred to the current main repository for GZDoom. If you want to create a fork of GZDoom please use coelckers/gzdoom instead!
